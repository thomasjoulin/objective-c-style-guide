# Thomas Objective-C Style Guide

This is a fork of the New York Times style guide, using the same structure to document my personal coding style.

## Introduction

Here are some of the documents from Apple that informed the style guide. If something isn't mentioned here, it's probably covered in great detail in one of these:

## Dot-Notation Syntax

Dot-notation should **always** be used for accessing and mutating properties. Bracket notation is preferred in all other instances.

**For example:**
```objc
view.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
```

**Not:**
```objc
[view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate;
```

## Spacing

* Indent using 4 spaces. Never indent with tabs. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode.
* Braces are always on their own line.
* There is always a space after keywords (`if`, `while`, `for`, `return`) and `=`, `,`, `>` etc...
* There is no space before `;` and one after (`for (i = 0; i < 42; i++)`)
* There is no space between parenthesis or before a method name

**For example:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy)
{
    //Do something
}
else
{
    //Do something else
}
```
* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but often there should probably be new methods.
* All variable used by the method should be declared first, one per line and variable named aligned. A blank line should follow, before the method code.
**For example:**
```objc
- (void)example
{
    NSString  *username;
    NSInteger age;

    NSLog(@"%@ is %d years old", username, age);
}
```

## Conditionals

Conditional bodies should always use braces even when a conditional body could be written without braces (e.g., it is one line only) to prevent [errors](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide/issues/26#issuecomment-22074256). These errors include adding a second line and expecting it to be part of the if-statement. Another, [even more dangerous defect](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/16530) may happen where the line "inside" the if-statement is commented out, and the next line unwittingly becomes part of the if-statement. In addition, this style is more consistent with all other conditionals, and therefore more easily scannable.

**For example:**
```objc
if (!error)
{
    return success;
}
```

**Not:**
```objc
if (!error)
    return success;
```

or

```objc
if (!error) return success;
```

### Ternary Operator

The Ternary operator, ? , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement, or refactored into instance variables.

**For example:**
```objc
result = a > b ? x : y;
```

**Not:**
```objc
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y;
```

Note, this is valid and encouraged:

```objc
result = value ?: default;
```

which is the equivalent of
```objc
result = value ? value : default;
```

## Error handling

When methods return an error parameter by reference, switch on the returned value, not the error variable.

**For example:**
```objc
NSError *error;
if (![self trySomethingWithError:&error])
{
    // Handle Error
}
```

**Not:**
```objc
NSError *error;
[self trySomethingWithError:&error];
if (error)
{
    // Handle Error
}
```

Some of Apple’s APIs write garbage values to the error parameter (if non-NULL) in successful cases, so switching on the error can cause false negatives (and subsequently crash).

## Methods

In method signatures, there should be a space after the scope (-/+ symbol). There should be a space between the method segments, no space between parameter type and name.

**For Example**:
```objc
- (void)setExampleText:(NSString *)text image:(UIImage *)image;
```
## Variables

Variables should be named as descriptively as possible. Single letter variable names should be avoided except for iterators (like `i`) in `for()` loops.

Asterisks indicating pointers belong with the variable, e.g., `NSString *text` not `NSString* text` or `NSString * text`.

Property definitions should be used in place of naked instance variables whenever possible. Direct instance variable access should be avoided except in initializer methods (`init`, `initWithCoder:`, etc…), `dealloc` methods and within custom setters and getters. For more information on using Accessor Methods in Initializer Methods and dealloc, see [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW6).

Instance variable, when used, should be prefixed with an underscore, and in a anonymous class extension.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NYTSection: NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *headline;

@end
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface NYTSection : NSObject
{
    NSString *_headline;
}
```

**Anonymous class extension:**

```objc
@interface NYTSection ()
{
    NSString *_headline;
}

@end

@implementation NYTSection
...
```

## Naming

Apple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible, especially those related to [memory management rules](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html) ([NARC](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2865194/340508)).

Long, descriptive method and variable names are good.

**For example:**

```objc
UIButton *settingsButton;
```

**Not**

```objc
UIButton *setBut;
```

Properties should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase.

### Underscores

When using properties, instance variables should always be accessed and mutated using `self.`. This means that all properties will be visually distinct, as they will all be prefaced with `self.`. Local variables should not contain underscores.

## Comments

Comments are frowned uppon because they don't compile, so they are often outdated. When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.

## init and dealloc

`dealloc` methods should be placed last at the bottom of the implementation. `init` should be placed first. 

`init` methods should be structured like this:

```objc
- (id)init
{
    if ((self = self = [super init]))
    {
        // Custom initialization
    }

    return self;
}
```

## Literals

`NSString`, `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, and `NSNumber` literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects. Pay special care that `nil` values not be passed into `NSArray` and `NSDictionary` literals, as this will cause a crash.

**For example:**

```objc
NSArray      *names = @[ @"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul" ];
NSDictionary *productManagers = @{ @"iPhone" : @"Kate", @"iPad" : @"Kamal", @"Mobile Web" : @"Bill" };
NSNumber     *shouldUseLiterals = @YES;
NSNumber     *buildingZIPCode = @10018;
```

**Not:**

```objc
NSArray      *names = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul", nil];
NSDictionary *productManagers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Kate", @"iPhone", @"Kamal", @"iPad", @"Bill", @"Mobile Web", nil];
NSNumber     *shouldUseLiterals = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];
NSNumber     *buildingZIPCode = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:10018];
```

## CGRect Functions

When accessing the `x`, `y`, `width`, or `height` of a `CGRect`, always use the [`CGGeometry` functions](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html) instead of direct struct member access. From Apple's `CGGeometry` reference:

> All functions described in this reference that take CGRect data structures as inputs implicitly standardize those rectangles before calculating their results. For this reason, your applications should avoid directly reading and writing the data stored in the CGRect data structure. Instead, use the functions described here to manipulate rectangles and to retrieve their characteristics.

**For example:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = CGRectGetMinX(frame);
CGFloat y = CGRectGetMinY(frame);
CGFloat width = CGRectGetWidth(frame);
CGFloat height = CGRectGetHeight(frame);
```

**Not:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = frame.origin.x;
CGFloat y = frame.origin.y;
CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
CGFloat height = frame.size.height;
```

## Constants

Constants are preferred over in-line string literals or numbers, as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace.

**For example:**

```objc
#define CompanyName     @"The New York Times Company"
#define ThumbnailHeight 2
```

## Enumerated Types

When using `enum`s, it is recommended to use the new fixed underlying type specification because it has stronger type checking and code completion. The SDK now includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types — `NS_ENUM()`

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, NYTAdRequestState)
{
    NYTAdRequestStateInactive,
    NYTAdRequestStateLoading
};
```

## Private Properties

Private properties should be declared in class extensions (anonymous categories) in the implementation file of a class. Named categories (such as `NYTPrivate` or `private`) should never be used unless extending another class.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NYTAdvertisement ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) GADBannerView *googleAdView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) ADBannerView  *iAdView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIWebView     *adXWebView;

@end
```

## Image Naming

Image names should be named consistently to preserve organization and developer sanity. They should be named as one lowercase case string, words separated by dashes with a description of their purpose.

**For example:**

* `refresh-bar-button-item` / `refresh-bar-button-item@2x` and `refresh-bar-button-item-selected` / `refresh-bar-button-item-selected@2x`

## Booleans

Since `nil` resolves to `NO` it is unnecessary to compare it in conditions. Never compare something directly to `YES`, because `YES` is defined to 1 and a `BOOL` can be up to 8 bits.

This allows for more consistency across files and greater visual clarity.

**For example:**

```objc
if (!someObject)
{
}
```

**Not:**

```objc
if (someObject == nil)
{
}
```

-----

**For a `BOOL`, here are two examples:**

```objc
if (isAwesome)
if (![someObject boolValue])
```

**Not:**

```objc
if ([someObject boolValue] == NO)
if (isAwesome == YES) // Never do this.
```

-----

If the name of a `BOOL` property is expressed as an adjective, the property can omit the “is” prefix but specifies the conventional name for the get accessor, for example:

```objc
@property (assign, getter = isEditable) BOOL editable;
```
Text and example taken from the [Cocoa Naming Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingIvarsAndTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001284-BAJGIIJE).

## Singletons

Singleton objects should use a thread-safe pattern for creating their shared instance.
```objc
+ (instancetype)sharedInstance
{
   static id sharedInstance = nil;

   static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
   dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
      sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];
   });

   return sharedInstance;
}
```
This will prevent [possible and sometimes prolific crashes](http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/2011/04/singletons-your-doing-them-wrong.html).
